# Overview

This is a fairly basic python program. It has 2 sections. One is a mortgage calculator. This calculates a loan or mortgage payment based on the user input.
In then diplays from a file places that user could hypothetically afford based on the payment. It also gives the user an option to input their information that will be
written to a file that could hypothetically be sent to real estate angents in their corresponding areas.

The other section is sort of funny. This would be used for a new real estate agent that has no idea where to move to start their practice. This section of the programs
prompts the user for 5 different places and then randomly selects one for them. I got the idea from a fantasy football program I Used that randomly selects who
you should start for you if it could go either way.

Python is a very well known programming language. Before this project I did not know any Python. I used these past 2 weeks to write this program to allow myself
to become comfortable with Python.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used just VS code to write this program.

This is only written in python

# Future Work

- verify the places input by the user are real places
- connect this with a real database to link the mortgages to more realistic price ranges
